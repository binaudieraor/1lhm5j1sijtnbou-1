<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Supercharger Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Roots Supercharger</li><li>Twin-Screw Supercharger</li><li>Centrifugal Supercharger</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The supercharger market comprises three main types: Roots, Twin-Screw, and Centrifugal superchargers. Roots superchargers utilize two meshing lobes to compress air, providing immediate power but with lower efficiency at high RPMs. Twin-Screw superchargers feature rotors that compress air more efficiently, offering better performance at varying RPMs and smoother power delivery. Centrifugal superchargers use a turbine-like design to accelerate air, delivering power based on engine speed and typically offering higher efficiency at higher RPMs, making them popular in performance applications.</p></p>
